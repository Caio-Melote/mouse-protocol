/**
 * Rapoo's vendor configuration channel (VT9 Pro and its family).
 *
 * Two independent sources pin the layout down, and they agree byte for byte:
 *
 * - a capture from a real VT9 Pro on 2026-09-29 (receiver 0x24AE:0x1205,
 *   cable 0x24AE:0x4405) reading every register below twice, on both links;
 * - mousectl's `rapoo_vt3pro` driver, reverse engineered from Rapoo's own
 *   `RapooGameDevDriver` 1.6.29, which documents the same frame and the same
 *   addresses for the VT3 PRO.
 *
 * The request is 31 bytes of output report 0xBA on the 0xFF00:0x000E
 * interface: one connection byte, then 30 payload bytes.
 *
 *     [0] connection byte          [1] command
 *     [2] payload length           [3..6] address, u32 little endian
 *     [7..] data
 *
 * Those 31 bytes are the *report data*: the report id goes to the transport
 * separately, the way WebHID's `sendReport` and OpenMouse Bridge take it.
 * Windows reports the same report as 32 bytes because `HidP_GetCaps` counts
 * the id, and hidraw wants it prepended - both of those are this 31 plus one
 * byte. Sending 32 bytes of data instead is refused before it reaches the
 * mouse (measured in the browser: `Failed to write the report`).
 *
 * The answer travels back through GET_REPORT(Input) rather than as an
 * interrupt-IN report, which is why WebHID cannot see it: the browser has no
 * equivalent call. Transports that can issue it (Windows `HidD_GetInputReport`,
 * Linux `HIDIOCGINPUT`, OpenMouse Bridge's `receiveInputReport`) deliver the
 * report id stripped, leaving the status byte first:
 *
 *     [0] status, 0x01 when the frame was answered
 *     [1] 0 for every block answer, non-zero on a battery answer
 *     [2] battery percentage on a battery answer
 *     [4..] payload
 *
 * Two measured properties of the link shape every caller, so they belong here
 * rather than in a driver:
 *
 * - **the channel is lossy.** About 40% of frames are dropped without the
 *   device ever going busy (busy is a status byte other than 0x01). An OK that
 *   was not preceded by a busy is the *previous* command's answer, so a read
 *   has to be retried, and "no answer" never means "no such register";
 * - **the connection byte is not validated.** 0xFF and 0xA5 both answered, as
 *   did 0x00, 0x01 and 0x5A. A dropped frame must therefore never be read as
 *   "wrong connection type".
 *
 * Everything in this module is transport independent: it encodes frames,
 * decodes answers, and turns register blocks into protocol values. Retries,
 * sleeps and the read-modify-write of a live device belong to the driver.
